# Investigation of frame-tie in the era of multiwavelength celestial reference frame

## *Descriptions*
---

The celestial reference frame (CRF) is a cornerstone of several
scientific domains in the astronomy, geodesy, and deep space
mission. 
The current fundamental reference frame is the third
generation of International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3,
Charlot et al. 2020), which is consisted of positions of
extra-galactic objects (mostly Active Galactic Nucleus (AGNs))
measured by the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at
S/X-, K-, X/Ka-band (8, 24, and 32 GHz, respectively). 
Although these three components are all obtained by VLBI, they
can be considered as independent since they use different networks
and observational strategies. 
At the optical domain, the Gaia mission provides an independent realization of reference
frame, Gaia-CRF2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018), with
an accuracy comparable to the ICRF3. 
We are stepping, for the first time of modern history, into an era of multi-wavelength
celestial reference frame, in the sense of independent celestial
frame realizations with comparable accuracies of microarcsecond
level.

An accurate celestial reference frame is crucial for space
geodetic techniques and in the measurement of Earth orientation
by VLBI and other satellite techniques (GNSS, DORIS, SLR)
and serves in Earthâ€™s deep interior studies based on Earth rotation
variability (Bffett 1992; Buffett et al. 1993; Mathews et al.
2002). It has also strong applications in astrometry and astronomy
including tests of fundamental physics (General relativity:
Lambert & Le Poncin-Lafitte (2009, 2011), Titov et al. (2018);
Lorentz invariance: Le Poncin-Lafitte et al. (2016)), the estimate
of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves: Gwinn et al.
(1997); Titov et al. (2011)), measurement of the Galactic rotation
(e.g., Titov et al. 2011; Titov & Lambert 2013; MacMillan
et al. 2019). [The United Nations Committee of Experts on the
Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM)](http://ggim.un.org/knowledgebase/KnowledgebaseCategory37.aspx) has
already recognized the importance of the reference frame and
established a resolution to encourage studies and developments
of a Global Geodetic Reference Frame, including the ICRF and
International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).

In the era of multi-wavelength celestial frame, a reliable and
consistent celestial reference frame enables interpreting the observations at different wavelengths correctly. 
Besides, the comparison
between positions at several bands opens a new door
to understand the astrophysical properties of AGNs (e.g., Plavin
et al. 2019) and search for strong gravitational lensing candidates
and dual AGNs (e.g., Orosz & Frey 2013). 
In a global sense, the
co-existing independent realization of CRFs at different wavelengths
allows separating systematical error from other signals,
which cannot be done by inter-comparison between merely two
catalogs (e.g., Liu et al. 2019).
The celestial reference frames based on observations at different
frequencies need to be linked together and construct a
multi-wavelength celestial reference frame. In this process, the
centers of emission of AGNs measured at different frequencies
are usually assumed to coincide (e.g., Karbon & Nothnagel
2019). However, this assumption does not always hold due to
several reasons. The first one is the technique-dependent bias,
for instance, alignment and deformations in the celestial frame
(Liu et al. 2019). The core-shift and source structure effect on
both optical and radio measurements would also result in an offset of emission centers (Kovalev et al. 2008; Porcas 2009; Petrov
& Kovalev 2017a). Other cases include the existence of host
galaxy, photometric variability, strong gravitational lensing, and
dual AGNs (Bachchan et al. 2016; Frouard et al. 2018; Makarov
et al. 2019). These effect needs to be mitigated to permit a reliable
link of celestial frames, especially the frame-tie between
the Gaia-CRF and ICRF, which is also a non-trivial task for the
Gaia mission.

The efforts to improve the frame-tie accuracy could be
made in two ways simultaneously. 
On the one hand, the large-scale
systematics and astrophysical effects (core-shift effect and
source structure) could be studied and then modeled, if possible,
before the frame-tie. 
On the other hand, the frame-tie could
be carried out via an ensemble of well-selected sources whose
position is less affected by the effects mentioned above.
The proposed project aims to address several problems related
to the frame-tie of the multi-wavelength reference frame,
using the next data releases of Gaia, i.e., Gaia EDR3 and DR3,
as well as the up-to-date VLBI solutions. These problems include

- (i) examination of large-scale errors in the reference frames;
- (ii) selection of suitable AGNs and optimization of the frame tie;
- (iii) understanding relation of the absolute position and frequency
for AGNs.
